Learning Objectives:-
Install Ansible on the control node.
Configure the `ansible` user on the control node for ssh shared key access to managed nodes. Do not use a passphrase for the key pair.
Create a simple Ansible inventory on the control node in `/home/ansible/inventory` containing `node1` and `node2`.
Configure sudo access for Ansible on `node1` and `node2` such that Ansible may use sudo for any command with no password prompt.
Verify each managed node is able to be accessed by Ansible from the control node using the `ping` module. Redirect the output of a successful command to `/home/ansible/output`.


Additional Information:-
Your CIO has greenlit a proof of concept for Ansible in your environment. You are to set up an Ansible control node in a test environment and verify basic functionality. You have three demo hosts, one to be the control node (control1), and two to serve as managed nodes (node1 and node2). You must complete the following steps:

1. Install Ansible on the control node.
2. Configure the ansible user on the control node for ssh shared key access to managed nodes.
	Note: do not use a passphrase for the key pair.
3. Create a simple Ansible inventory on the control node in /home/ansible/inventory containing node1 and node2.
4. Configure sudo access for Ansible on node1 and node2 so that Ansible may use sudo for any command with no password prompt.
5. Verify each managed node can be accessed by Ansible from the control node using the ping module. Redirect the output of a successful command to /home/ansible/output.

Important Notes:
You might have to create user "ansible" on all servers.
The ansible user has the same password as the cloud_user.
/etc/hosts entries must be present on control1 for the managed nodes.

Solution

1) steps to add new user and give sudo access

adduser ansible   -- then give password and leave all fields blank
usermod -aG sudo ansible
su - ansible

Add ansible user in sudoers file so that it won't askfor password
sudo visudo
ansible     ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

2) add inventory file in /home/ansible
vi inventory
and add then add ip address for node 1 

[node1]
hostfrominventory ansible_ssh_host=172.31.19.175

3) run command to check connectivity

ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-245:~$ ansible all -i /home/ansible/inventory -m ping

[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Distribution Ubuntu 18.04 on host hostfrominventory should use /usr/bin/python3, but is using /usr/bin/python for 
backward compatibility with prior Ansible releases. A future Ansible release will default to using the discovered platform python for this 
host. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information. This feature will be 
removed in version 2.12. Deprecation warnings can be disabled by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
